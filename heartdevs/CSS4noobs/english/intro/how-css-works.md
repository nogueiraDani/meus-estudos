# How CSS works

The CSS works through a simple structure of selector, property and value.

Then, all of our code blocks, are made as follows:

```css

selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
  ...
}
```

Where:

- __Selector__: HTML element that it'll be style (for example: a div, a paragraph, a section). You can get better about the selectors by acessing the page of [selectors](./../../Modulo-Basico/selectors.md).

- __Propriedade__: o que ser√° mudado no nosso seletor (por exemplo: a cor do texto, a cor de fundo do elemento, o tamanho dele).

- __Property__: What it's going to be changed in our selector (for example: the tex color, background color, its size).

- __Value__: How the property is going to be applied (for example: to set a color `red` for our property `color`).
